What's here?
------------

The `cmip_data.load` submodule contains functions for loading cmip data, radiative
kernels, and climate feedback and sensitivity tables. The `cmip_data.download`
submodule contains functions for downloading and averaging cmip data. The
`download_wgets` function creates ESGF wget scripts for retrieving CMIP5 data,
and the `filter_wgets` function consolidates these into a single scripts and filters to
within the desired time range -- e.g. if there are 500 years of data but we only need a
100 year climatology. The `merge_files` function can then be used to create
climatologies with optional standardized horizontal and vertical coordinates from the
files downloaded via the wget script generated by `filter_wgets`.
