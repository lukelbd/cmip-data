What's here?
------------

This repository contains functions for generating `wget` scripts that download
CMIP6 and CMIP5 data, filtering and consolidating the `wget` scripts to specific
time ranges or overlapping experiments, remapping data onto standardized horizontal
grids, interpolating model levels onto standardized pressure levels, consolidating
data into time series or averages, and calculating climate feedbacks and other
physical variables from the time series and averages. See the docstrings for
details and the top-level python executables for example usage.
